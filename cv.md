## About myself
For 7 years I worked in  "Mingaz", developed as a technical specialist and acquired skills in personnel management, management of production activities.
In 2020, I decided to change the sphere in favor of a more promising industry. I have successfully completed two educational courses on Front-end development and am ready to apply the acquired knowledge in my work. I have a little experience in freelancing. I know the basics of SEO (SEO, optimization). I am able to quickly understand the assigned tasks, I work with a large amount of information. I’m keen to develop professionally!
